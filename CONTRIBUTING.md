# Want to contribute? Here are the steps!

1. Create an issue in Github with all the necessary information and add a relevant label:
    - `feature addition` for a new feature,
    - `bug` for a bug,
    - `enhancement` for enhancement e.g. refactoring etc.

You should then see ticket in the backlog of the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/yasgreen93/objectives-organiser-api).

2. When you start working on the ticket, create a branch that begins with the issue number and then explains what you intend to do, e.g. 30-refactor-validation. Then push your new branch to origin, waffle will automatically move the ticket to the "In Progress" column.

3. When you are finished, create a pull request from your branch to `master` with the title of the PR being the ticket number followed by the ticket title e.g. "30 refactor validation". In addition, put the ticket number in the PR comment, e.g. "closes #30". Waffle will then link this PR to the ticket.

4. Assign me (yasgreen93) as a reviewer and add the label `waiting for review`.

5. If I approve I will comment a "LGTM ðŸŒˆ" and then will merge your PR. Otherwise I will add comments/questions.
